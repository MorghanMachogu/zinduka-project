# ZINDUKA! – Fighting Femicide through Tech

## 📍 Project Overview

**Zinduka** is a web-based platform designed by students of Kabarak University to combat the rising femicide crisis in Kenya. Inspired by activism and driven by data, Zinduka offers an anonymous reporting system, survivor support, emergency resources, legal aid, and donation opportunities — all in one safe digital space.

> 💡 *“We refuse to let victims be reduced to mere statistics.”*

## 🧠 Background

Femicide in Kenya has reached alarming levels, with over 500 cases reported in 2024 alone. Despite numerous organizations working on this issue, significant gaps remain in:
- Anonymous reporting
- Legal support accessibility
- Survivor-centered digital tools
- Scalable and transparent donation models

**Zinduka** aims to fill those gaps with a tech-powered, community-driven solution.
